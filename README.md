# HealthTech

This is a project that We've build in a 36 hrs hackathon, 
It is a model of Improve Healthcare which predicts the Health statistics of all states of India, using the 
concepts of data mining based on datasets provided by "Ministry of statistics and Programme Implementation" and "data.gov".
Our basic moto is to dynamically shows predicted trends and provides a complete overview of diseases and deaths on state and 
national level.
Currently we're redesigning and reconstructing it in a better way.
